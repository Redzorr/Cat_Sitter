# Cat_Sitter
College VR Project
Added 3 sounds: Ambient sound for the living room, purring sound on loop for the cat, and glass tapping sound for the mug when picked up.
Added 2 audio reverb zones: One surrounding the whole living room with the living room setting, and one around the cat bowl with the cave setting to create an echo effect.
